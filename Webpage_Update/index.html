<p> There have been many people in the past that talk about what they want to be, whether it was to become a doctor, a firefighter, a police officer, or an engineer. I have heard it all. However, I believe an occupation that is commonly overlooked is becoming an entrepreneur. Many wealthy people that started a business, started off working for a company as an ordinary worker. However, what differs between them and the ordinary was the mindset and thought put into changing something in the world that had the power to revolutionize the world. There are still many great entrepreneurs out in the world currently, making the world more efficient and easier. I have plans that involve digital assets and Bitcoin that has the potential to revolutionize currency altogether.

<p> Collaboration is an essential aspect of life, whether at work or in social activities with friends. I get along well with those around me, thanks to my personal qualities. I strive to be calm, collected, and charismatic toward others whenever I can. In group projects, I usually try to break the ice by starting conversations with my teammates. Once we’re comfortable, I take the lead to get everyone working. When conflicts arise, I work to clear things up, de-escalate tensions, and help the group reach a consensus. </p>

<p> One of my major accomplishments in high school was making new friends. I moved to Dublin, California, in 2023 without knowing anyone. By being open to socializing and building a good reputation, I succeeded in making friends with nearly half the students in my grade. </p>

<p> Throughout my life, I have always aspired to become a successful businessman. Thank you for reading through this “About Me” by Tyler Chiu. </p>
